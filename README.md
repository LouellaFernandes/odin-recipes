# odin-recipes
This is Louella's first project ever.
The current project requirement by TOP is to create a repo and clone it from GitHub to the host machine. 
HTML is the key skill that will be used in this project. 
Sounds like it will be a recipe blog or something along the lines. Time to figure it out.
