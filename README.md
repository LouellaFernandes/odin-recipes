# odin-recipes
This is Louella's first project ever.
The current project requirement by TOP is to create a repo and clone it from GitHub to the host machine. 
HTML is the key skill that will be used in this project. 

The project will be based on 'Recipes' and I've chosen this to be Chocolate-based desserts' recipes.

Further Development:
I'm likely to create a further copy of this to make it more visually appealing. Sticking to the basics for now, so stay tuned!
