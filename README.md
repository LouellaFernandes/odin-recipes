# odin-recipes
This is Louella's first project ever.
The current project requirement by TOP is to create a repo and clone it from GitHub to the host machine. 
HTML is the key skill that will be used in this project. 

The Project will be based on Recipes and I've chosen this to be Chocolate-based desserts' recipes.
